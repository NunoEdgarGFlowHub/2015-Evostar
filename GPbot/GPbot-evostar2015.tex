\begin{abstract}
Determining the end of the evolutionary process in the design of a game bot is not as easy as it would seem a priori. The first issue is that there is no optimum, because most games make sure that there is no optimum way of creating a bot that defeats all enemies. Then, in most games fitness is noisy, so that even if you use a certain level of fitness as a termination condition, this is going to change every generation it is evaluated. Finally, if you use external enemies and a certain level of victories over them the bots will be overfitted to those particular enemies. Even as any of these conditions is not perfect, there is the possibility of combining several of them as termination conditions so that bots that are as optimal as possible (and in as general a context as it is possible) are found; also, if possible, in a minimal amount of time and evaluations. In this paper we will examine several ways of determining the end of an evolutionary game bot design process, determining the capabilities of every one of them and, eventually, selecting one for future designs. We will use a game, Planet Wars, in which we already have some experience, but the conclusions to our study could, in principle, be extended to any RTS or even any game with non-deterministic match results.

\section{Introduction}

The termination condition in Evolutionary Algorithms is a key factor in the experimental setups, as it ... Usual termination conditions are a fixed number of generations or evaluations, a fixed amount of time the best solution is not improved, or 

In the scope of the noisy and combat-based problems...

The termination condition chosen can be applied to any game with stochastic behavior and combat-based results. In this paper, Planet Wars has been chosen in the experimental setup, as it is a simplified RTS game (only one type of resource, one type of attack and one type of unit).
