\section{Introduction}

The termination condition in Evolutionary Algorithms is a key factor in the experimental setups, as it ... Usual termination conditions are a fixed number of generations or evaluations, a fixed amount of time the best solution is not improved, or 

In the scope of the noisy and combat-based problems...

The termination condition chosen can be applied to any game with stochastic behavior and combat-based results. In this paper, Planet Wars has been chosen in the experimental setup, as it is a simplified RTS game (only one type of resource, one type of attack and one type of unit).
