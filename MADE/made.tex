\begin{abstract}
Generating fictional worlds according to some specific requisites
presents the problem that it is impossible to know in advance the optimum for the
particular fitness function designed at the same time it creates a
vast search space for the evolutionary algorithm parameters that it
needs. In this paper our objective is to find a methodology for finding the
best parameters of the evolutionary algorithm in the design of
fictional worlds. This evolutionary design includes running, to
completion, a world represented as a chromosome and assigning a fitness to it, so it is a problem
with a very complex fitness landscape. That is why, in order to
optimize resources given to evolution and also have some guarantee
that the final result will be close to optimal, we systematically
study the values of different parameters to try and find a set of
rules that will, once you have the fitness function, help you set a
reduced range of values o even a single value that will, with a
reduced computation budget, help you find an optimal world.

\section{Introduction}

In the very competitive cultural industry, writers rack their minds in
order to generate interesting fictional worlds, mainly for the
creation of richer environments in modern videogames. In order to make
generation of these fictional worlds and the stories within them truly efficient and massive,
several methods have been proposed \cite{garcia14my,nairat:evolution}. One of them, called MADE
\cite{garcia14my} finds ``interesting'' character stories by running
an evolutionary algorithm that optimizes a fitness function designed
from the archetypes that best describe the world the client wants.

MADE works as follows: every individual in an evolutionary algorithm
is described by a chromosome that represents one (or several kinds of)
finite state automaton that are set to live in a simulated
environment. The evolutionary algorithm was run with standard
parameters and {\em sensible} default values were given to several
non-evolutionary parameters such as the number of profiles needed to
obtain the desired result and or the size of the simulated
world. There was no attempt to optimize these parameters, since the
main intention seemed to be to have a prototype that allowed the
authors to have an acid test of their proposed approach.

That paper hinted at the fact that parameters such as the number of
{\em profiles} (different kind of finite state automaton present in
the world) had a big influence on the outcome, to the point of making
it possible or not. However, other parameters such as the number of
simulated days the world is running might also have some influence.

In this paper we will use that open source simulator and look at it
from the evolutionary point of view so that we can check what kind of
influence they have in the outcome. We will do a experimental setup
that will test different parameters, and eventually find a series of
rules that will help the users of that framework to set the best
values for their simulation. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Coming up next, we
present the state of the art in parameter setting of simulated
worlds. Next we will present the experimental setup we follow in this
article, whose results will be shown in Section \ref{sec:res}. Finally, we will
present the conclusions reached in this paper.

\section{State of the Art}

The work of Nairat et al. \cite{nairat:evolution} ...

\section{Methodology and experimental setup} %Issue #12
\label{sec:met}

In this section we will show how to systematize the different steps of the proposed method to generate a fictional world. Initially, the fitness should be decided considering the desired behaviour of the agents that populate the world (for example, a given quantity of some archetype). To facilitate the generation of different personalities different number of ``profile'' could be required. This concept, presented in \cite{}, describes the different sets of behaviour parameters of the agents in the world (the number of different FSMs). Therefore, a world with 3 profiles is composed by 3 different types of agents. However, and as will be probed in this paper, the number of profiles could be different of the number of desired archetypes.

Then, the characteristics of this world are also decided taking into account the expected... For example, adding enough days to allow the archetypes generation. Finally, the interesting plot points are extracted from the log using... 



In this work, we propose three scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
\item Scenario A: The Villains. This scenario only requires one type of archetype: The ``villain''. This 
\item Scenario B: The Hero. As in the classic stories, when a villain appears, a hero must rise. The ``hero'' archetype depend on the existence of a ``villain'' archetype. This scenario tries to generate worlds formed by archetypes that depend of anothers.
\item Scenario C: The Shakespearian story. As many of the great stories of The Bard, this world requires the existence of different and interdependent archetypes: The ``hero'' and ``villain'' are completed with the ``obstacle'' (QUE HACE QUE), the  ``mentor'' (QUE HACE QUE) and the ``avenger'' (this archetype does not depend on the others).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Designing a fitness function}

The first step requires to develop a fitness function that takes into
account the quantity of the desired archetypes. This fitness function
should facilitate the existence of diversity in the desired
archetypes: that is, it is better that the world has 25\% of
``villains'' and 25\% of ``heroes'' than 50\% of ``villains'' and no
``heroes''. Thus, we propose the following fitness function: 

\begin{equation}
\sum _{i=1}^{A} {\log \left( 1+10p_{i}\right) } \over {\log 1}
\end{equation}

where $A$ is the number of desired archetypes, and $a_{i}$ is the
percentage (from 0 to 1) of a specific archetype in the world. % Why
                                % logs and all the rest? - JJ FERGU: TODO hablar de arquetipos

In this paper, three fitness functions will be studied, related with the previously explained scenarios:
\begin{itemize}
\item Function 1: for the scenario A . This function requires the maximization of the ``villain'' archetype, trying to maximise the number of villains in the world. 
\item Function 2: for the scenario B. In this, case, the ``hero'' archetype... and villain ()
\item Function 3: for the scenario C... This function requires 5 different archetypes. These archetypes have some type of interdependence. hero villano obstaculo mentor y vengativo %(este no deènde de nadie)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Individual representation}

An individual in the EA is a vector of parameters that model the behaviour of {\em all} the agents in the world (keep in mind that an individual of the EA is not equal to an agent in the world). These parameters have been presented in \cite{garcia14my}, and they define the transitions and states of a Finite State Machine that model the agent's behaviour. 

This vector of parameters is composed by several {\em profiles}. The number of profiles has a direct relation with the desired fitness function. It is expected that functions with only one kind of archetype (such as F1) only would require one profile (or set of parameters). However, as explained in \cite{garcia14my}, to allow the existence of different personalities in the world, different sets of personalities (or profiles) can be evolved at the same time. Therefore, the number of profiles affect the generated fitness, as the chromosome will be larger.

\subsection{System optimization}


Once the fitness function has been decided, several parameters related with the world and the GA will be studied. As explained before, the parameters that define a literary story are the time, the world, the characters and the object. In this paper, we use the elements defined in MADE: number of days (time), a grid (world), food (object) and rats (characters).

%TODO rubén, que no se te olvide hablar de esto en la intro como viene en el issue y que esté relacionado con lo que pongo aquí. Por ejemplo, llamar al "object" de otra forma

Different parameter values for each element will be studied to clarify their influence in the literary world generation. First, it is expected that the number of days will have a significant impact, as larger values will allow the generation of more backstories. The set of days to study will be 64, 128 and 256. The world size (size of the grid in this paper: 5x5, 10x10 or 20x20) can also influence in the execution of the story, as larger worlds could make the agents spent more time exploring before an event occurs. The food, or the element that condition the actions (attack, share and defend among others), also could have enough effect in the story generation: lower quantities of food may increase the attacks, creating more aggressive agents, and larger quantities may generate more generous agents. Different proportions of food depending of the world size will be studied (food placed in 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 of the size of the map).

Also, it is expected that the existence of different personalities (or number of profiles) in the world will have a significant effect in the runs, specially in functions that require more than one archetype. We will compare the usage of 1, 2, 4 and 8 profiles in each scenario. As the usage of different number of profiles generate different
individual sizes, and therefore different convergence times, the stop
condition will be established depending of the best fitness (30 generations without improvement), to do a fair comparison.

Finally, the parameters of the GA also affect the generation of the desired world. In this paper, we study the population size, a parameter that has big effect in the execution of this kind of algorithms \cite{}, comparing populations of 64, 128 and 256 individuals. %TODO citar a un paper de tamaños de poblacion

Table \ref{tab:parameters} summarizes all the configuration parameters that will be compared (with their acronyms used in this paper), and the rest of the (fixed) parameters of the algorithm. The fixed values of the parameters of the GA have been usually described by other authors as...

The rest of the parameters of the MADE environment, such as the initial number of agents in the world, and the agent's parameters (such as the lifespan) are described in \cite{garcia14my}. In this paper we will use the default values presented in that work.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:res}


In this paper, 9720 runs were carried out for each problem (30 times * 4 levels for \emph{P} * 2 levels for \emph{D} * 3 levels for \emph{W} * 3 levels for \emph{S} * 3 levels for \emph{F} that represent the possible combinations) to obtain the fitness for each combination.


As the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test determines that the data we are using not follow a normal distribution a Kruskal–Wallis test have been performed. This test is a non-parametric test, which means that it does not assume that the data come from a normal distribution. 


The application of Kruskal-Wallis consisted in running the EA optimization method using those parameter combinations to obtain the best fitness. 
The response variable used to perform the statistical analysis is the fitness at the end of the run. The changes in the response variable are produced when a new combination of parameters is considered. Then, the {R} \footnote{{\tt http://www.r-project.org}} tool was used to obtain the Kruskal-Wallis tables as well as the tables of means and figures for each problem. 

Obtained Kruskal-Wallis tables show for each factor, the  degrees of freedom (FD), the experimental value of the statistical F (F value) and its associated p-value.
As previously stated, if the output is smaller than 0.05, then the factor effect is statistically significant at a $95\%$ confidence level (what indicates that different initial values of this parameter lead to significant differences on the fitness). 

As a significant F-value only tells  that the effects are not all equal (i.e., reject the null hypothesis), post-hoc tests might be used to determine which effects or outputs are significantly different from which other.

Results show that all the parameters considered have a significant impact in the generation of the agents.
